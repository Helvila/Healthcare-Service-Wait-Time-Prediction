# Hospital Waiting Time Prediction
Overview
This project is created to practice and showcase my skills in data science and machine learning. The dataset used for this project is fabricated and generated using Mockaroo. The primary goal is to develop a predictive model and deploy an interactive dashboard using Streamlit.

Features
Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, outliers, and incorrect data entries.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding data distribution and relationships between variables.

Feature Engineering: Creating meaningful features to improve model performance.

Predictive Modeling: Developing a machine learning model to estimate waiting time.

Dashboard Deployment: Visualizing insights and predictions using Streamlit.

Dataset
Source: Fabricated dataset created using Mockaroo.

Purpose: Used for skill development and practice.

Patient Name: Name of the patient (removed for anonymity in processing).

Age: Age of the patient.

Gender: Male/Female.

Department: The hospital department the patient visits (e.g., Cardiology, Neurology, etc.).

Consultation Type: Type of consultation (e.g., Emergency, Regular, Follow-up).

Arrival Time: The time the patient arrives at the hospital.
