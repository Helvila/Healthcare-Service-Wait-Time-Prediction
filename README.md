# Hospital Waiting Time Prediction

## Overview
This project is created to practice and showcase skills in data science and machine learning. The dataset used for this project is fabricated and generated using Mockaroo. The primary goal is to develop a predictive model and deploy an interactive dashboard using Streamlit.

## Features
- **Data Cleaning**: Comprehensive cleaning process including handling missing values, outliers, and incorrect data entries to ensure data quality and reliability.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: In-depth analysis of data distribution and relationships between variables to gain meaningful insights and inform modeling decisions.

- **Feature Engineering**: Creation of meaningful features from raw data to improve model performance and capture complex patterns in patient waiting times.

- **Predictive Modeling**: Development of machine learning models to estimate hospital waiting times based on various patient and hospital factors.

- **Dashboard Deployment**: Interactive visualization of insights and predictions using Streamlit, providing an intuitive interface for users.
