# Predicting Customer Waiting Times to Optimize Service Efficiency

Overview:
- Problem: Long waiting times for customers lead to dissatisfaction and lost business.
- Objective: Build a predictive model to estimate waiting times and optimize resource allocation.
- Dataset: Mock data generated using Mockaroo, containing 500 records of customer service interactions.

This is a synthetic dataset created for portfolio demonstration purposes. While it aims to reflect realistic patterns in healthcare services, it should not be used for actual healthcare service planning without proper validation against real-world data.
